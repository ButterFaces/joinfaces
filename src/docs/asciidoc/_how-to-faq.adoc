=== Traditional war deployment

JoinFaces can be used in traditional web applications which are deployed to an existing servlet-container.

1. Create a deployable war file as descibed in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring-boot-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-create-a-deployable-war-file[_Spring Boot Reference Guide_].
2. Mark all dependencies as `provided` which will be provided by the server you are deploying to.
(Keep in mind that full Java-EE servers like Glassfish or WebLogic already provide a JSF implementation and other
Java-EE related libraries which the joinfaces starters have to pull in for embeddede containers.)
3. The FacesServlet configuration through `joinfaces.faces-servlet` will not work correctly if Springs
`ServletContainerInitializer` implementation is executed after the one provded by the JSF implementation.
You can configure it the traditional way in `web.xml` if this happens.
